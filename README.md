# Week Eight Day Three: Rational Class (Version 2)

In this assignment, you'll be adding to your implementation of the Rational class. Please see Canvas for details on the classwork/homework.

Add code to [Rational.java](src/main/java/Rational.java) to do the desired thing.

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [RationalClient.java](src/main/java/RationalClient.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

## Run your tests with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyTests.java](src/test/java/MyTests.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make test
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew test
